As of 2021, the estimated number of people to have ever lived is
100,000,000,000.  This is calculated with a cutoff point of 50,000BCE of when
modern humans arose and includes estimated infant mortalities.  The current
number humans living is 7,900,000,000 people, which is 7.9% of the number of

Fermat's Last Theorem, first stated in 1637, says that there is no integer
solution to \\[ a^n + b^n = c^n \\] when \\[ n > 2 \\]. Fermat casually wrote
this in the margin of a book along with a note: “I have discovered a truly
marvelous proof of this, which this margin is too narrow to contain”.  Proving
this claim became a great unsolved problem until 1994, when Andrew Wiles used
advanced maths --- that would have been unavailable in 1637 --- to prove it.
Many believe Fermat never actually had a proof.

When Coca-Cola first launched in 1886, it contained cocaine from the coca leaf
and caffeine from the kola nut, hence the name. It originally contained ~9mg of
cocaine (a typical recreational dose is ~50mg) and ~78mg of caffeine per cup (a
cup of coffee contains ~100mg). In 1903 the cocaine was removed. 
In 1911, the US Government sued to force
Coca-Cola to remove caffeine (due to it being habit-forming), ultimately
resulting in a settlement and a reduction to ~22mg caffeine per cup.

In 1931, Kurt Gödel shook the foundations of mathematics. Gödel proved that
within any sufficiently complex system of mathematics there are some statements that
are true --- but unprovable. He proved that if mathematics is
consistent (there are no logical contradictions) then it will be incomplete 
(there is not a proof for every true statement). He then went on to show that
any consistent system of mathematics cannot prove its own consistency. These
are Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems.

mathematics.
These problems are: (1) The Yang–Mills and Mass Gap, (2) The Riemann

(5) The Hodge Conjecture,
(6) the Poincaré Conjecture, and 
(7) the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture.

The speed of light is always constant. This is wildly different than the way
speed works for everyday objects. If your friend shoots an arrow and you run
after it, the arrow moves away from your friend faster than it moves away from
you.  But if your friend shines a flashlight and you “run after the photons”,
the photons move away from you both at the same speed. What changes is
that the light appears slightly more blue to you. This is relativity and the
redshift effect. It prevents information paradoxes from occurring.

The lava lamp was invented in 1963 and originally consisted of colored paraffin
wax and tetrachloromethane in water andmineral oil. In 1970, the use of
tetrachloromethane (and tetrachloroethylene) was discontinued due to toxicity,
and in 2021 the exact formulation of commercial lava lamps is an undisclosed
trade secret.  For a lava lamp to work it is important that the materials near
perfectly balance the density of the wax and water, which is why the wax rises
as it heats and sinks as it cools.

The touch lamp was first patented in 1953, became commercially available in
1955 and made use of vacuum tubes. The components used in these original lamps
were expensive, which prevented them from gaining widespread popularity until
the 1980's, when their cost dramatically dropped due to the advent of cheap
integrated circuits. Touch lamps work by detecting changes in surface
capacitance, which is the same principle by which smartphone touch screens in
2021 operate.
