As of 2021 the current best estimated age of the universe is 13.787Â±0.020
billion years.  This is based on studies of the cosmic microwave background,
the current observed expansion rate of space, and the age of the oldest
observable stars, and has an uncertainty of only 20 million years.

The Bekenstein bound states that the maximum amount of information
(/energy/matter) that can exist in a region of space is surprisingly not
related to it's volume, but instead to it's surface area. If this limit is
exceeded that region of space collapses into a black hole.

As of 2021 the best estimated age of the earth is 4.543 billion years.  This is

the same time as the other bodies in the solar system.

in ~400CE. It became Middle English in ~1,000 CE, Early Modern English in
1400CE, and Modern English in 1600CE.
