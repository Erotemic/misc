My top monitor seems to randomly dim sometimes when I'm working. I have 3
monitors attached to a 3090 GPU on Ubuntu. Running Driver Version: 535.183.01
but it has happened with other drivers.

Its subtle, at first I thought it was my eyes going bad, but I'm pretty sure it is a real dim.

All monitors are the same LG monitors, and it only seems to happen to 1. In
this instance a minute or two later (as writing this) it seemed to go back to
normal.

Not sure how to submit this as a bug. Seems very tricky to determine the root cause.
