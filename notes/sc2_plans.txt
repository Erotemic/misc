SC2 Custom Map: Plans

* Precode several "plans", there is a UI that lets you select and transition
  between plans. AI handles the macro.


Example: 

Opener Plan:

* 2 Gate 
* 1 Gate Cyber Nexus
* 1 Gate Nexus Cyber
* Expand into Stargate
* Forge Fast Expand
* Forge Cannon
* Custom


Mid Game:
* 3 Gate - Robo
* 3 Gate - Stargate
* Essentially allow a toggle on unit producing structures

* AI handles probe transfers and probe saturation.

* Can toggle a pylon/prism for constant warpins or do it manually (there should
  be a red indicator when warp ins are ready in the UI)

* Can place buildings in defined locations without having the requirements met
  (pylon, gas, etc..) buildings are started once requirements are met. Allows
  you to plan the layout of your base without having to do it in real time.

* All available upgrade panel, don't need to look at specific building.


Late Game:

* Late games are ill-defined because buildings can be destroyed and weird
  things can happen. 

* Plans should attempt to maintain constant production of units. User should be
  able to disble this by toggle.

* User should have a target unit composition that the AI builds towards. If an
  archon dies it replaces the archon.

* User should have target maximum worker count in UI that the AI builds towards
  and tries to maintain good saturation.

* User will likely have to choose when/where to expand, can't automate that.


Micro Plans:

* It might be fun to have the AI do no micro, but maybe we can automate it a
  bit so the game feels more like high-level strategy and less like low level
  execution and reaction, although that will still come into play.

* Automatic unit splitting versus splash
* Automatic blink backwards micro (togglable)
* Automatic stutter step run away
